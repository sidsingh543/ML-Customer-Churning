# ML-Customer-Churning
Completed a customer churn prediction project using a real-world dataset. Applied a variety of classification techniques in Python, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks, and support vector machines (SVM) to predict customer churn based on demographic and usage data. Performed thorough data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling), and applied feature selection techniques to improve model performance.

Evaluated and compared models using multiple metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Also explored hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to improve generalization. The final report included detailed analysis of model trade-offs, interpretability vs. performance, and recommendations for stakeholder implementation. Achieved strong predictive performance and gained hands-on experience in building, validating, and interpreting classification models in a business context.
