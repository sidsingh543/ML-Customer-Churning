# ML-Customer-Churning
ML-Customer-Churning is a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn using demographic and usage data from a real-world dataset. The workflow included extensive data preprocessing such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features, and applying feature selection to enhance predictive performance. Multiple classification techniques were implemented in Python, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks, and support vector machines (SVM), with each model evaluated and compared using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. To ensure robustness and generalization, the project incorporated hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, while also exploring the trade-offs between interpretability and predictive power across models. The final analysis provided actionable recommendations for stakeholders, supported by detailed diagnostics and performance comparisons. This project demonstrates applied expertise in classification modeling, model evaluation, and business-focused machine learning for customer retention strategies.
